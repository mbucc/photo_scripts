Shell scripts for photo management.

    pdups.sh        Check for duplicate photos.

                            Usage: pdups.sh <rootdir>

    pshuffle.sh     Reshuffle photos into directories named YYYY-MM.
                    It's designed to be idempotent, and worked that
                    way in my environment, but test first!  (To test,
                    change "mv ..." commands in script to "echo mv ..." 
                    and run script).

Requires exiv2 (http://www.exiv2.org/).

    brew install exiv2.
